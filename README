mpc-ncurses is a ncurses client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.  
The client connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local network.
By default,  mpc-ncurses  connects  to  localhost:2100.   This  can  be
changed  either  at  compile-time,  or  by  exporting  the MPD_HOST and
MPD_PORT environment variables, or by the command line  options  --host
and --port.

	$ mpc-ncurses --host=musicserver --port=44000


Note!
If your are connecting to a MPD server with a version newer than 0.9.x 
and you dont use utf-8 as your  charset set the CHARSET enviroment variable.

	$ export CHARSET=ISO_8859-1
