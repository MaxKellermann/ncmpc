ncmpc is a ncurses client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.  
The client connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local network.
By default,  ncmpc  connects  to  localhost:2100.   This  can  be
changed  either  at  compile-time,  or  by  exporting  the MPD_HOST and
MPD_PORT environment variables, or by the command line  options  --host
and --port.

	$ ncmpc --host=musicserver --port=44000
