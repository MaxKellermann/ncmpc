Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ncmpc is a curses client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD). ncmpc connects to 
a MPD running on a machine on the local network, and controls this with an 
interface inspired by cplay. 

Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, and wave files) and managing playlists. MPD is 
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides 
control for music playback over a local network. Read more at musicpd.org
