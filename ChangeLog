	* Added copyright notice and license notice 
	* Major cleanup of the 'screen' handling routines. The goal of this 
	  is to simplify addition of 'screens' (like a key editor).
	* added a key editor -> screen_keydef.c
	* configure.ac - added a --enable-key-editor to enable/disable the 
	  build in key editor.

	* support.c - use screen_status_printf() to display character 
	  conversion errors. Only use stderr if DEBUG is enabled.
	* screen_file.c - make shure curses repaint the screen when adding 
	  a directory (force a update of the status message).
	* screen_play.c - highlight and center even when paused.
	* list_window.c - optional wide cursor (fill to eol).
	* screen.c - use get_key_names() for the keys displayed in the
	  welcome message (help, playlist, browse).
	* configure.ac - updated version, added SYSCONFDIR define to CFLAGS.
	* conf.c - moved configuration file to ~/.ncmpc/config
	         - added support for key bindings in ~/.ncmpc/keys
	         - added support for global configuration in SYSCONFDIR/ncmpc
		 - added parameter to enable/disable wide cursor
	* command.c - added command names (used with key bindings)
	            - added utility functions (for key bindings). 
	* screen_help.c - cleanup, use key descriptions from command.c
	* main.c - check key bindings and exit if something is strange.

	* list_window.c - use clrtoeol instead of wclear. This improves the
	  speed and removes some flickering.
	* main.c - poll mpd twice/second instead of once, print a newline 
	  after closing curses.
